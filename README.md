Problem Set: Algorithmic Challenges
This repository contains solutions to the following problems:

Problem 1: Sudoku Validator With Custom Zones
Validate a 9x9 Sudoku board. In addition to the standard validation of rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids, validate custom zones where each zone consists of 9 unique cells. Each zone must contain the digits 1 through 9 without any repetition.

Problem 2: Alien Dictionary
Given a sorted list of words from an alien language, determine the order of characters used in that languageâ€™s alphabet.

Problem 3: Knights and Portals
Given a grid, find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can move to adjacent empty cells, and you are allowed to teleport exactly once between any two empty cells in the grid.

Problem 4: Bitwise Matching Pattern
Given an integer n, find the next larger integer that has the same number of set bits (binary 1s) as n.

Problem 5: Matrix Islands with Diagonals
Count the number of islands in a 2D matrix containing 0s and 1s. Islands are defined by connected 1s horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Bonus Challenge (Optional): Mini Interpreter
Build a simple interpreter that can evaluate:

let variable declarations and assignments

if conditions with basic integer comparisons and single-level blocks

The interpreter maintains variable states and supports simple integer arithmetic.

How to Run
Each problem solution is implemented in Java.
